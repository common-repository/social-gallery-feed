A widget that displays your Instagram profile with details and recent feed. 

== Description ==

= One Stop for all your Instagram needs =

Create Instagram gallery with your recent image uploads. Define what attributes are displayed like username, bio or number of followers. Set how many images are shown and how many columns you want.
<strong>That is it!</strong>

= Nice and simple style fits in every theme =

Hovering over an image shows overlay with caption (or start of it in case it is too long) and number of likes and comments. Click gets you to Instagram image page to comment or like.

No loading with javascript that can fail (like in many other Instagram widgets). No ajax to wait for on startup.
